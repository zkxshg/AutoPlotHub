## Introduction

In software development, visualizing code logic and relationships can greatly enhance understanding and communication. However, manually creating these visualizations can be time-consuming and error-prone. This repository provides a set of tools that automate the process of generating code-based plots, allowing developers to focus more on their code and less on manual diagram creation.

## Tools Included

- **GPT + PlantUML**: Automatically generate PlantUML code based on provided prompts using GPT language model.
- **GPT + Mermaid.js + Markdown**: Generate Mermaid.js code for various types of diagrams based on given text prompts using GPT language model.

## Usage

To use these tools, simply follow the instructions provided in each tool's respective directory. You may need to install dependencies and configure settings based on your specific requirements.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for improving existing tools or would like to add new tools, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
